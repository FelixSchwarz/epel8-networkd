Subject: [PATCH] cryptsetup: don't use %m if there's no error to show

We are not the ones receiving an error here, but the ones generating it,
hence we shouldn't show it with %m, that's just confusing, as it
suggests we received an error from some other call.

(cherry-picked from commit 2abe64666e544be6499f870618185f8819b4c152)
